How to extract frames from a video. Really good for AI training (image recognition)


Consider this libraries to be installed in a environment:
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog, messagebox, ttk
import cv2
import os
from pathlib import Path



Just only select a video file and create all frames or a frame per x seg. That's all.
